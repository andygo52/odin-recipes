    <h2>Description</h2>

        <em>I didn't always look like this. <br>
            I used to be a different person. <br>
             I would struggle to wake up each morning, groggy.  <br>
             My eyelids felt like they had weights on them, <br>
             making it a momentous struggle to open them. <br>
              I would drag myself each morning to Mr. Coffee and make a morning brew.<br>
                That helped. <br>
                 That helped me make it to work and kept me going until about mid-morning.<br>
                   Then I felt like I needed another coffee. <br>
                    Another coffee! <br>
                    Yes! That was the key!  <br>
                    That was the lift, the boost I needed to keep going!<br>
                     Always keep going!<br>
                      I was a teacher after all, and I needed pep! vim! vigor! to teach each lesson and help the students.<br>
                        Yes, mid-morning coffee was definitely appreciated,<br>
                         and kept me going until lunch. <br>
                          But then what happened?<br>
                            Somehow, everyday after lunch, <br>
                            I felt tired again, <br>
                            and so guess what? <br>
                             I had an afternoon coffee!!!!  <br>
                            Ahhhhhh.......the wonders of afternoon coffee!!!<br>
                            What had been a slump<br>
                             was now transformed<br>
                              into a beautiful afternoon!<br>
                              Oh, what great afternoons I had!<br>
                              What epiphanies!<br>
                              Until....until....until....<br>
                              Until it was time to go home from work.<br>
                              Then, all of a sudden, I felt depleted! <br>
                              Woe is me! <br>
                              No energy to be found!<br>
                              But...but....but....<br>
                              But I wanted to have a good evening!<br>
                              And so.......<br>
                              Either before I left work, <br>
                              or as soon as I got home, <br>
                              I made myself another cup of coffee! <br>
                              But for some reason <br>
                              the evening cup of coffee<br>
                              didn't help as much. <br>
                              I didn't get the boost I experienced <br>
                              from coffee during the day. <br>
                              I would start feeling less energy, <br>
                              tiredness would come upon me, <br>
                              and so.......<br>
                              as a last-ditch effort,<br>
                              I would try one more cup of coffee<br>
                              hoping for that heavenly elixir...<br>
                              But alas, no matter what I tried,<br> I had less energy in the evenings<br>
                              and eventually.....<br>
                              I...would...get................<br>
                              tired. <br>
                              And so, it was off to bed. <br>
                              The next day, the cycle would repeat.<br>
                              And the next day, and the next day<br>
                              and the next day....<br>                       
                            
                            </em>
                            </p>

        <p><strong>------------------------And NoW?!!!!!!!!!!----------------------</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Every morning I wake up.  No grogginess anywhere!<br>

        Every morning I make a Green Smoothie to start my day.<br>
        This is the foundation 
        of a vegan raw foods lifestyle that is healthy, <br>
        helps me maintain a normal blood sugar level, <br>
        and provides me with plenty of energy 
        throughout the day.<br>
         My Green Smoothie is a combination of water, fruit,<br> greens, vegan raw protein powder and cinnamon. <br>
